# Machine Learning-Aided First-Principles Prediction of Earth-Abundant Pnictogen Chalcohalide Solid Solutions for Multi-junction Solar Cells

This project introduces a novel framework for discovering novel families of materials composed of earth-abundant elements and characterized by non-toxicity, high thermodynamic stability and simple low-temperature synthesis processes, is paramount for the advancement of urgently needed energy storage and conversion technologies. Pnictogen chalcohalides, represented by the general formula ABC (A = Bi, Sb; B = S, Se; C = I, Br), emerge as a promising class of energy materials particularly well-suited for photovoltaic applications. However, the compositional landscape of Bi\textsubscript{x}Sb\textsubscript{1-x}S\textsubscript{y}Se\textsubscript{1-y}I\textsubscript{z}Br\textsubscript{1-z} is vast and remains largely unexplored, with traditional experimental and theoretical exploration techniques facing limitations in covering the entire solid-solution range due to their labor-intensive and time-consuming nature. Here, we introduce an integrated bottom-up approach that combines first-principles calculations and machine learning models to provide a comprehensive fundamental understanding of pnictogen chalcohalides with arbitrary composition and expedite the design of high-performance multi-junction solar cells. The introduced bottom-up materials design approach may facilitate an unprecedented and rapid translation of basic knowledge into the most demanded solar cell applications.

Please be aware that the code is under active development, bug reports are welcomed in the GitHub issues!

## Installation

To download the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IonRepo/ML-PCH.git
cd ML-PCH
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution

A set of user-friendly jupyter notebook have been developed, which can be run locally with sklearn and pymatgen dependencies. It predicts ground-state energy and optoelectronic properties for pnitogen chalcohalide-based solid solutions from density functional theory first-principles calculations.
