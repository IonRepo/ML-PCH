# Machine Learning in Crystals

## Overview

This project consists of a series of codes for extracting data from large databases of solid crystals and machine learning programs for predicting certain properties, such as the diffusion coefficient or the free Helmholtz energy. The machine learning programs primarily utilize convolutional graph neural networks.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your training data by preprocessing and augmenting the crystal data as necessary.
2. Run the training script, specifying the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training data.
3. Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualization tools.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new crystal structures.

For more detailed instructions and code examples, refer to the documentation provided in the respective directories of the machine learning models.
